# ONTAP_ACL
Simple shell scripts to help manage ONTAP ACLs from a Linux client

Support for these scripts will be limited. Be sure to test these scripts before applying to any production data. One way to test these scripts effectively would be to leverage ONTAP's FlexClone technology or to stand up a new Storage Virtual Machine and copy the data to a new location via SnapMirror or other means.
